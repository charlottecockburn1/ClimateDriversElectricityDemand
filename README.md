Code for paper: Assessing the Climate Drivers of Global Electricity Demand

## OVERVIEW 

ClimateDrivers_Final.pynb : Jupyter notebook containing all statistical modeling and figures for the paper. Data can be found here. 

Daily_ERA5_Extractions : Folder containing scripts for extracting daily minimum, maximum, and averages temperature, dew point temperature, and moist enthalpy from the raw ERA5 hourly data, which can be found [here](https://gdex.ucar.edu/datasets/d633000/). 

Monthly_ERA5_Extractions: Folder containing scripts for extracting monthly temperature, cooling degree-days, enthalpy, and seasonal enthalpy climatologies from the intermediate files produced by the daily extractions, which can be found here. 

Temporary_FinalDatasets: Temporary storage of end-stage data to support the review process. These files contain all data needed to replicate figures and tables (using AssesingDrivers_Final.pynb). These files, along with intermediate ERA5 netCDF files, will be moved to a final repository on Zenodo upon acceptance.
